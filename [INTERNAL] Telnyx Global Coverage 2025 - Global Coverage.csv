,,"PLEASE READ: 

This document is internal, and the entire sheet should NOT be shared externally. To share information with a prospect: copy the file and screenshot or copy the cells related only to the targeted countries -- only share necessary information. Information in column L (Key Things to Know - Sales Bullets), for instance, include notes that you should use during your live conversations with the prospect.

About column K (Numbers Catergory): 

Cat A: These numbers can be sold without any restrictions to all our customers including the largest and most critical ones. 

Cat B: These numbers cannot be resold, therefore should not be sold to SaaS. MSPs/SIs customers typically provide these numbers to Enterprise customers. These numbers can be sold without any restriction to customers using them for their own business (Enterprises, Digital Natives, etc...). 

Cat C: Check with Numbering team (#help-global-number-coverage) before selling. These numbers should not be sold to SaaS or critical customers (large MSPs, SIs, Enterprises or Digital Natives). 

Full PSTN replacement is a feature set, it allows you the same abilities as if you were using a local operator in each region. It's full feature parity of inbound and outbound local calling, geographic, and national number resources, emergency service-enabled numbers, Calling Line Identity (CLI) passthrough, dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, and number portability. 
Note 1: The qualification of PSTN replacement is not applicable to Mobile or  Toll-Free numbers.
Note 2: Full PSTN replacement does not imply a full coverage of the country, our coverage (set of numbers) can be partial. Please see additional information here : (This is a work in progress - I will link here once done - Paul)
